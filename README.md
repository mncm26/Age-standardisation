# Age-standardisation

This analysis involves the calculation and visualization of the crude death rate, age-specific death rates, and age-standardized death rate per 100,000 for all age groups in both the United States and Uganda for the year 2019. 
The population and mortality data are sourced from the United Nations' World Population Prospects, available at https://population.un.org/wpp/. The age-standardized death rates are computed using the World Health Organization's (WHO) World Standard Population distribution (%).
Although age-standardized death rates do not reflect the actual (crude) death rates, they are essential for making valid comparisons between countries with differing age demographics.
